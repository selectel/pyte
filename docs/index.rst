``pyte`` users
--------------

Believe it or not, there're projects which actually need a terminal emulator
library. Not many of them use ``pyte``, though. Here's a shortlist the ones
that do:

* `Ajenti <http://github.com/ajenti/ajenti>`_ -- a webadmin panel for Linux
  and BSD uses ``pyte`` for its terminal plugin.
* `Pymux <https://github.com/jonathanslenders/pymux>`_ -- a terminal multiplexor.

.. note:: Using ``pyte``? Add yourself to this list and submit a pull request.


Show me the code!
-----------------

Head over to our brief :ref:`tutorial` or, if you're feeling brave, dive right
into the :ref:`api`; ``pyte`` also has a couple of examples in the
`examples <https://github.com/selectel/pyte/tree/master/examples>`_ directory.
