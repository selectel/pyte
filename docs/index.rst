``pyte`` users
--------------

Believe it or not, there're projects which actually need a terminal emulator
library. Not many of them use ``pyte``, though. Here's a shortlist the ones
that do:

* `Ajenti <http://github.com/ajenti/ajenti>`_ -- a webadmin panel for Linux
  and BSD, which uses ``pyte`` for its terminal plugin.
* `Pymux <https://github.com/jonathanslenders/pymux>`_ -- a terminal
  multiplexor.
* `BastionSSH <https://github.com/wcc526/bastion-ssh>`_ -- a tool for
  protecting, monitoring and accessing multiple SSH resources.
* `Jumpserver <https://github.com/jumpserver/jumpserver>`_ -- an open source
  springboard machine(fortress machine): authentication, authorization,
  audit, automated operation and maintenance.
* `Byexample <https://byexamples.github.io>`_ -- a literate programming engine
  where you mix ordinary text and snippets of code in the same file and then
  you execute them as regression test similar to
  `doctest <https://byexamples.github.io/byexample/recipes/python-doctest>`_.

Head over to our brief :ref:`tutorial` or, if you're feeling brave, dive right
into the :ref:`api`; ``pyte`` also has a couple of examples in the
`examples <https://github.com/selectel/pyte/tree/master/examples>`_ directory.
