What is ``pyte``?
-----------------

It's an in memory VTXXX-compatible terminal emulator.
*XXX* stands for a series of video terminals, developed by
`DEC <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Equipment_Corporation>`_ between
1970 and 1995. The first, and probably the most famous one, was VT100
terminal, which is now a de-facto standard for all virtual terminal
emulators. ``pyte`` follows the suit.

So, why would one need a terminal emulator library?

* To screen scrape terminal apps, for example ``htop`` or ``aptitude``.
* To write cross platform terminal emulators; either with a graphical
  (`xterm <http://invisible-island.net/xterm/>`_,
  `rxvt <http://rxvt.net/>`_) or a web interface, like
  `AjaxTerm <http://antony.lesuisse.org/software/ajaxterm/>`_.
* To have fun, hacking on the ancient, poorly documented technologies.

**Note**: ``pyte`` started as a fork of `vt102 <http://github.com/samfoo/vt102>`_,
which is an incomplete pure Python implementation of VT100 terminal.


Installation
------------

If you have `pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable>`_ you can do the usual::

    pip install pyte

Otherwise, download the source from `GitHub <https://github.com/selectel/pyte>`_
and run::

    python setup.py install
