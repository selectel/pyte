pyte Changelog
==============

Here you can see the full list of changes between each pyte release.

Version 0.4.5
-------------

Technical release, released on September 1st

- Created MANIFEST.in file
- Added CentOS spec file

Version 0.4.4
-------------

Bugfix release, released on July 17th

- Removed `pdb` calls, left from `HistoryScreen` debugging -- silly,
  I know :)

Version 0.4.3
-------------

Bugfix release, released on July 12th

- Fixed encoding issues in `DebugStream` -- Unicode was not converted
  to bytes properly.
- Fixed G0-1 charset handling and added VAX42 charset for the ancient
  stuff to work correctly.

Version 0.4.2
-------------

Bugfix release, released on June 27th

- Added a tiny debugging helper: ``python -m pyte your escape codes``
- Added ``Screen.__{before,after}__()`` hooks to ``Screen`` -- now
  subclasses can extend more than one command easily.
- Fixed ``HistoryScreen`` -- now not as buggy as it used to be:
  and allows for custom ratio aspect when browsing history, see
  ``HistoryScreen`` documentation for details.
- Fixed `DECTCEM` private mode handling -- when the mode is reset
  ``Screen.cursor.hidden`` is ``True`` otherwise it's ``False``.

Version 0.4.1
-------------

Bugfix release, released on June 21st 2011

- Minor examples and documentation update before the first public
  release.

Version 0.4.0
-------------

Released on June 21st 2011

- Improved cursor movement -- ``Screen`` passes all but one tests
  in `vttest`.
- Changed the way ``Stream`` interacts with ``Screen`` -- event
  handlers are now implicitly looked up in screen's ``__dict__``,
  not connected manually.
- Changed cursor API -- cursor position and attributes are encapsulated
  in a separate ``Cursor`` class.
- Added support for `DECSCNM` -- toggle screen-wide reverse-video mode.
- Added a couple of useful ``Screen`` subclasses: ``HistoryScreen``
  which allows screen pagination and ``DiffScreen`` which tracks
  the changed lines.

Version 0.3.9
-------------

Released on May 31st 2011

- Added initial support for G0-1 charsets (mappings taken from ``tty``
  kernel driver) and SI, SO escape sequences.
- Changed ``ByteStream`` to support fallback encodings -- it nows
  takes a list of ``(encoding, errors)`` pairs and traverses it
  left to right on ``feed()``.
- Switched to ``unicode_literals`` -- one step closer to Python3.

Version 0.3.8
-------------

Released on May 23rd 2011

- Major rewrite of ``Screen`` internals -- highlights: inherits from
  ``list``; each character is represented by ``namedtuple`` which
  also holds SGR data.
- Numerous bugfixes, especialy in methods, dealing with manipulating
  character attributes.

Version 0.3.7
-------------

First release after the adoption -- skipped a few version to reflect that.
Released on May 16th 2011

- Added support for ANSI color codes, as listed in ``man console_codes``.
  Not implemnted yet: setting alternate font, setting and resetting
  mappings, blinking text.
- Added a couple of trivial usage examples in the `examples/` dir.
